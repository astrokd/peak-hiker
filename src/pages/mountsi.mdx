## Mount Si

Mount Si is the prototypical Cascade Mountain Range peak hike and a great place to start Peak Hiking.  It's high with many switchbacks through rock and forest on the side of a mountain.  At the top, there is a spectacular view of the local maintains, North Bend below, and Mountain Rainer to the south.  The first thing you will see when you arrive at the top is a large rock pile, generally, this is where a lot of hikers stop but the trail does continue on up through the rock where you can get more views to the West and North and see Mounts Si's true peak a large rock structure called the Haystack.  There are different ways to get to the peak but the most common is the Mt Si Trail.
